Update 2/21/2018: Please check back on Saturday (will add comments and some pictures to explain how I got things to work)


Small Business App (with a partner)

You are going to design an App for a small business (you pick the business!)

You will need the following:

    * At least two Activities.
    * Save at least one data point with a SharedPreference.
    * Send at least one data point between Activities using an Intent.
      Read in input from the user using at least one of each:

    1. Checkbox
    2. TextView
    3. Radio Button (use a ButtonGroup)

    * Have at least on image in the application.
    * Include a BroadcastReceiver to deal with a system event.  Some examples are:

    1. Intent.ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED
    2. Intent.ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED
    3. Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_OKAY

Notify the user of the event (a Toast is fine but it is up to you).

    One Activity needs a ConstraintLayout and one Activity needs a LinearLayout (horizontal).
